for using flask first we have to install it by typing 
"pip install flask" in cmd or in anaconda prompt


once we have installed the flask, every time u want to run it the basic thing is to write
"import flask"


but this will not work with templates of bootstrap, for working with that we simply have to write
"from flask import Flask, render_template" or "from flask import *" the "*" will import everthing that the flask library have in it self.


now create an "app" variable and assign it with function having perameter "Flask(__name__)"
app=Flask(__name__)


The route() decorator in Flask is used to bind URL to a function. For example -
@app.route(‘/hello’)
def hello_world():
   return ‘hello world’
Here, URL ‘/hello’ rule is bound to the hello_world() function. As a result, if a user visits http://localhost:5000/hello URL,
the output of the hello_world() function will be rendered in the browser.


the return function basically return the thing we want display 
return render_template('Home.html')
it will return the page home.html

their should be a templates folder in same folder in which the coding is. the html file will be in that templates folder.

the html file will be simple no css or pictures would be connected with it. if we want to connect it with them a folder will be made naming static.
the html file and the other files in another folder will be connect with each other through Jinja templating.
